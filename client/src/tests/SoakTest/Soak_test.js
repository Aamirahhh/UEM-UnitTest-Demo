/*
Soak testing is used to validate reliability of the system over a long time

Run soak test to:
- Verify that your system doesn't suffer from bugs or memory leaks, which result in a crash or restart after
- Verify that expected application restarts don't lose requests
- Find bugs related to race-conditions that appear sporadically
- Make sure your database doesn't exhaust the allotted storage space and stops
- Make sure your logs don't exhaust the allotted disk storage
- Make sure the external services you depend on don't stop working after a certain amount of requests are executed

How to run a soak test:
- Determine the maximum amount of users your system can handle
- Get the 75-80% of that value
- Set VUS to that value
- Run the test in 3 stages. Ramp up to the VUS, stay there for 4-12 hours, rump down to 0
